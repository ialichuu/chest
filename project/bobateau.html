                        <p>It's finals season.</p>
                        <p>You know what that means.</p>
                        <p>It's time to hone in on your testing skills and find the perfect place to study with your best-tea (or your bo-bae).</p>
                        <p>Now all puns aside, if you go to The University of Texas at Dallas or have ever been in the Dallas area, you've probably seen at least one or two boba tea shops. From Kung Fu Tea, bobaLand, Boba Latte, and many, many others, the boba tea business is booming around here. </p>
                        <p>I, a self-proclaimed boba connoisseur, and many other of my fellow boba connoisseurs, cannot try out all of these shops while remembering what drinks I like at all of them.</p>
                        <p>This project was done for my Internet Studio course at UTD. My professor, Ken Starzer, provided feedback along the way.</p>

            <h3>Research</h3>

            <h4 style="text-align:center">Students Interested in Boba Tea (Primary)</h4>
            <img src="../bobateau/bobateau-persona.jpg">
            <h4 class="bobateau-font">Competitors</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/nearme/boba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yelp:</a> The closest desktop-based competitor. A business directory website and crowd-sourced review forum that integrates Google Maps. Users can find a variety of businesses and services, price points, waitlist, amenities, Q&A section, photo reviews, business hours, suggested businesses, and more.
                <li><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/boba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps:</a> The largest directory platform. Its main focus is the full-page map. Has satellite imagery, aerial photography, street maps, 360Â° panoramic views of streets, real-time traffic conditions, and route planning. </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trip Advisor:</a> Travel-focused directory platform. Essentially contains the same information and has a similar concept as Yelp.</li>
                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DennisaurCo.BobaNow&hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boba Now! (App):</a> Contains information such as business hours, sort by, distance, tea flavor options, and Yelp reviews are shown. Uses Google Maps and Yelp reviews integration.</li>
                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.projectfurball.teaaddict.android&hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tea Addict (App):</a> Enables users to find boba and bubble tea nearby at home or overseas with Google Maps integration. Users can submit edits, new, and missing stores in-app. Information such as store business hours, distance, user ratings, and user shares are shown.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="bobateau-font">Using The Six Thinking Hats Methodology</h4>
            <p>As defined by The de Bono Group, the <a href="http://www.debonogroup.com/six_thinking_hats.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">six thinking hats methodology</a> is a simple, yet effective parallel thinking process that helps people be more productive, focused, and mindfully involved. This methodology separates thinking into six clear functions and roles. I summarized and split each hat into sections under the two hats I thought correlated most with each other.</p>
            <h4>White hat & Blue hat</h4>
            <p>With BobaTeaU, users can look up boba tea places to see where they're located, directions on how to get there, along with reviews about the location itself and reviews about individual drinks. Users can keep track of drink flavors and customization options they like and don't like via their reviews that other users can see. Its primary audience is for high school and college students who like going to places off-campus, like boba tea shops, and who tend to study and hang out with their friends. The boba tea industry is currently booming with shops constantly opening all over UTD; therefore, having this website will be perfect for boba tea lovers. The success of this website will be measured by the amount of people who sign up and use BobaTeaU.</p>
            <h4>Black hat & Green hat</h4>
            <p>The most difficult part about getting this website to come together is the aggregation of data. For example, how would I accumulate all the information about the different drink options if each store menu varies? And, how much user input and menu data can I store on my web hosting server? This should be solved by keeping the initial implementation small and focused around the UTD area. There are also concerns about what counts as a "boba tea shop" as many places, like <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/taiwan-cafe-plano">Taiwan Cafe</a>, offer food and boba tea. I will solve this issue by only including shops that primarily market themselves as "boba tea shops."</p>
            <h4>Red hat & Yellow hat</h4>
            <p>This website's competitors are Yelp and Google. However, its niche is boba-focused. The main attraction is the diary option and ratings for individual drinks, as Yelp and Google don't offer those specific options. There's no need to ask for recommendations from people who don't share similar tastes with you. You can see what people customize their drinks with -- sweetness, ice level, and other adjustments -- with similar tastes. In addition, getting boba is already a social thing that many people, especially high school and college students, enjoy. With BobaTeaU, it'll grow even more as people can connect and share their opinions, find more information, and match their favorite drinks with others online.</p>

            <h2>Website Design & Implementation</h2>
            <h3>Sitemap Visualization</h3>

            <figcaption>This is my initial sitemap design for my website.</figcaption>

            <img src="../bobateau/bobateau-lo-fi-compilation.jpg">
            <figcaption>I designed low-fi wireframes of the website using pencil and paper.</figcaption>
            <img src="../bobateau/bobateau-competitors-lo-fi-compilation.jpg">
            <figcaption>Competitor wireframes were also taken into consideration.</figcaption>
            <h3>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <img src="../bobateau/bobateau-mid-fi-compilation.jpg">
            <figcaption>These mid-fi wireframes were designed in Adobe XD.</figcaption>
            <h3>Visual Design</h3>
            <img src="../bobateau/bobateau-visual-scheme.png">
            <figcaption>I incorporated a âblack milk teaâ color scheme onto my website. On the right are some of my initial logo designs before I settled on a white logo. I used the âUâ part of the logo for the websiteâs favicon.</figcaption>
            <p>As I was creating the final design of the website, I explained the concept of my website to three other students in my classroom, requested them to explore the website, and asked them their thoughts about it. They liked the overall color scheme and font choices for the site, as well as the concept of the âFind your perfect drinkâ button. The addition of the integrated Google maps and contact info under each location stood out to them. One of them compared it to a more niche version of Yelp. They also liked the âOther Boba Tea Shopsâ portion for recommendations.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the âFind Your Perfect Drinkâ page was severely empty without many drinks added. There was also a button that redirected back to the homepage which seemed meaningless. One suggested to use this space to promote the top drinks across all locations of boba places to have a section for the less educated boba drinkers to look and read more reviews. This would additionally aid with the overall flow of this page and complete the search page.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the design didnât have a reviews section since my idea consisted of a diary page that users could record their personal drinks in. However, it was difficult to implement that page. Therefore, my classmates suggested to add a public reviews section.
            </p>

            <h3>Live On WordPress</h3>
            <img src="../bobateau/bobateau-preview.png">
            <img src="../bobateau/bobateau-wp-compilation.jpg">
            <p>This was originally done in WordPress. However, I have since taken the site down as of December 2019. You may view the prototype I have done on Adobe XD.</p>
<a class="button center" href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/ebec66b7-472b-43e8-6e1d-d2ca46abfa92-9ddd/?fullscreen" role="button">VIEW MY SCREENSHOTS</a>
            <p>I used a <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/illdy/">custom theme called Illdy</a> to implement my design onto WordPress. I chose this theme because of the simplicity it offered and because it looked most like my wireframes. I also used several plugins to create a contact form, implement directory pages, and integrate Google Maps to each location page.</p>
            <p>I was unable to find a way to implement the search bar above the fold on the homepage with this WordPress theme. Therefore, I decided to remove the search page and allow users to see popular drink options via the âFind Your Perfect Drinkâ button. This page would ideally lead to another page that gathered the most popular items from user reviews.</p>
            <p>Since it was difficult to implement the diary page using the plugins I could find, I decided to remove this option and designed BobaTeaU solely as a boba tea shop directory and review site. Ideally, users can post reviews onto the respective shopâs page with suggestions like âTell your boba buddies how you customize your drink!â as a placeholder in the review box. A site admin will take quality reviews of the most popular drinks, put them into the testimonial section or âFind Your Perfect Drinkâ page where new or curious users can find the backlink to the shop it came from to decide whether they would like to order that for the day.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Although I have used WordPress in the past, this was a challenging project because I was designing my own product. Because of this, I had to research which plugins would work with my website idea and what the limitations of implementing and hosting a webpage WordPress were. Research played a crucial part in my design process and set the foundations for my ideas.</p>
            <p>If time constraints were not an issue and if I had more knowledge on how to manipulate a WordPress design from the backend, I would have liked to implement the diary option so users could easily track their favorite boba tea customization options and other users could use those as references. In addition, I would have also liked to implement the âTop 3 Drinksâ idea I had on my wireframe on a locations page.</p>
