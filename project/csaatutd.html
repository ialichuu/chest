                        <p>It's the start of the school semester. Students are wandering around the Student Organization Fair, looking for a new student organization to join with their friends. Interested students head to designated booths to learn more about a particular organization.</p>
                        <p>The Chemistry Student Association (CSA) is a club at The University of Texas at Dallas. The purpose of their website is to showcase their club to new and interested members. However, their website has been outdated since 2016 and is a mess for students to navigate through.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <h3 class="csa-font">Officer Interviews</h3>
                <p>To scope out what the pain points were for the website, I conducted stakeholder interviews with the 8 officers for the year of 2019 - 2020. Among the questions were...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What do you think of the website?</li>
                    <li>What is missing from the website that you would like to promote for the organization?</li>
                    <li>When you were a student interested in joining the Chemistry Student Association, would you have found the current site helpful? Why or why not?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I put together the <span class="csa-font">three main concerns</span> that the officers had:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Current CSA members view the Facebook page to keep up to date with events. The website is tailored for students who want to become members and are looking for more information about the club.</li>
                    <li>CSA sells lab equipment like goggles and carbon copy notebooks during the beginning of the year at a booth. However, students don't know that CSA still sells materials throughout the year and the officers would like to indicate that on their site.</li>
                    <li>Events are generally posted on Google Calendars then duplicated onto the Facebook page. Officers find it redunant to add another set of event information onto their website.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Overall, the team wanted to create a pleasant experience for UTD students who are interested in the Chemistry Student Association at The University of Texas at Dallas to go onto the page to learn more about the benefits for the club as well as upcoming events.</p>
                <h3 class="csa-font">User Personas</h3>
                <p>Using the data gathered from the interviews, there are <span class="csa-font">two types of users</span> who would want to use the site:</p>

            <p>I decided to pick the task of finding quick information about the student organization and focus on a few primary screens: Home, one of the Events page, and the About Us page. I used Nielsen's Usability Heuristics and focused on five heuristics. This is how I would identify opportunities for change.</p>

            <figcaption>The visuals I used for this website design minus the images used.</figcaption>
            <p>I used a simple monochromatic color palette, focusing on the color blue while adding orange to accent it. I chose this color palette because it was similar to the American Chemistry Society logo and website. However, the scheme is primarily light to give it a light-hearted and non-serious vibe to it because the goal of the Chemistry Student Association is to have fun doing chemistry, rather than the feeling of learning in a bleak lecture hall. I sprinkled in some simple chemistry-related icons I created in Adobe XD to add to the fun vibe.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways + Next Steps</h2>
            <p>I loved getting the opportunity to work with one of the student organizations at UTD. I’m pleased with the outcome of the new website design. I primarily worked with the Webmaster for the majority of the project. We established the initial wireframe and design together, and she gave me plenty of feedback during the design process along with her officers. After presenting the final product, the team was happy with the design.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, I couldn't find many related images for me to work with. Therefore, some of the hero images are out of focus. Nonetheless, the next step is to implement this design on WordPress. If I were to continue working with CSA, I would like to do user testing for interested students who want to join the Chemistry Student Association and conduct surveys to see how they like interacting with the website.... work with the webmaster to implement high quality photos</p>
