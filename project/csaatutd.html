                        <p>It's the start of the school semester. Students are wandering around the Student Organization Fair, looking for a new student organization to join with their friends. Interested students head to designated booths to learn more about a particular organization.</p>
                        <p>The Chemistry Student Association (CSA) is a club at The University of Texas at Dallas. They use their website to showcase their club to new and interested members. However, their website has been outdated since 2016 and is a mess for students to navigate through.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <h3 class="csa-font">Officer Interviews</h3>
                <p>To scope out what the pain points were for the website, I conducted stakeholder interviews with the 8 officers for the year of 2019 - 2020. Among the questions were...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What do you think of the website?</li>
                    <li>What is missing from the website that you would like to promote for the organization?</li>
                    <li>When you were a student interested in joining the Chemistry Student Association, would you have found the current site helpful? Why or why not?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I put together the three main concerns that the officers had:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Current CSA members view the Facebook page to keep up to date with events. The website is tailored for students who want to become members and are looking for more information about the club.</li>
                    <li>CSA sells lab equipment like goggles and carbon copy notebooks during the beginning of the year for two weeks at a booth. Flyers are hung around campus to advertise that. However, the officers would like to indicate that they still sell materials on their site throughout the semester.</li>
                    <li>Events are generally posted on Google Calendars then duplicated onto the Facebook page. Officers find it redunant to add another set of event information onto their website.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Overall, the team wanted to create a pleasant experience for UTD students who are interested in the Chemistry Student Association at The University of Texas at Dallas to go onto the page to learn more about the benefits for the club as well as upcoming events.</p>
                <h3 class="csa-font">Student Surveys</h3>
                <p>To understand the pain points that users have when searching for a student organization and their resources, I conducted an interview to gain insight on potential members. I wanted to learn more about interviewees':</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>General experience with student organizations</li>
                    <li>Motivations to join the organization</li>
                    <li>Concerns the students had to joining</li>
                </ol>
                <p>After interviewing 5 individuals, these were some of the main quotes I pulled:</p>
                <img src="../csaatutd/csa-user-interviews.png" style="max-width: 700px">
                <p>Surveys to 15 participants were also gathered regarding if students knew the Chemistry Student Association sold lab equipment and the results showed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>93.33% of participants were enrolled in classes that required lab equipment to be purchased</li>
                    <li>50% of participants knew that the Chemistry Student Association sold lab equipment</li>
                    <li>66.67% of participants bought their equipment via an online store (e.g. Amazon)</li>
                    <li>93.33% of participants didn't know that the organization had supplies still in stock after the two-week period</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="csa">
                    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Chemistry Student Association website is aimed toward students are interested and who want to learn more about the organization</li>
                        <li>Most students don't realize CSA sells equipment throughout the whole semester</li>

                <p>Once the experience was mapped out, I constructed a site map to outline all the necessary screens. The current sitemap was cluttered with unnecessary pages. All the pages are sitting at the top level, even the ones that should be in subfolders. From what was acquired in the card sorting data, the amount of pages has been condensed, and there are no extra pages that need to be in subfolders.</p>

                <p>After conducting the initial research and establishing the wireframe, the next goal was to create wireframes and gather feedback from the design. I quickly sketched out ideas for interfaces and potential journeys and discussed it with the organization's webmaster. The one page that wasn't already previously established was the "Buy Lab Equipment" page.</p>

                After... I began designing mid-fidelity wireframes on Adobe XD. While keeping the research I did in mind and discussing with the organization's webmaster..
                <img src="../csaatutd/mid-fi-compilation.jpg">
                <h3 class="csa-font">Visual Design</h3>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">

                </div>
                <p>I used a simple monochromatic color palette, focusing on the color blue while adding orange to accent it. I chose this color palette because it was similar to the American Chemistry Society logo and website. However, the scheme is primarily light to give it a light-hearted and non-serious vibe to it because the goal of the Chemistry Student Association is to have fun doing chemistry, rather than the feeling of learning in a bleak lecture hall. I sprinkled in some simple chemistry-related icons I created in Adobe XD to add to the fun vibe.</p>

                <h2>Reflection + Next Steps</h2>
                <p>I loved getting the opportunity to work with one of the student organizations at UTD. I’m pleased with the outcome of the new website design. I primarily worked with the Webmaster for the majority of the project. We established the initial wireframe and design together, and she gave me plenty of feedback during the design process along with her officers. After presenting the final product, the team was happy with the design.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, I couldn't find many related images for me to work with. Therefore, some of the hero images are out of focus. Nonetheless, the next step is to implement this design on WordPress. If I were to continue working with CSA, I would like to do user testing for interested students who want to join the Chemistry Student Association and conduct surveys to see how they like interacting with the website.... work with the webmaster to implement high quality photos</p>
