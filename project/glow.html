                        <b>Background</b>
                        <p>Acne affects everyone differently. Glow helps the user learn new information about their body, skincare, and medications to aid them in their journey to understand how their own lifestyle plays an effect on their acne. Those suffering can feel more self-confident taking the step to understand their acne and clear it.</p>
                        <br>
                        <b>Problem</b>
                        <p>People who suffer from acne sometimes don’t know or understand their acne’s origins. They try multiple products and/or medications that may or may not work on their specific type of acne, which leads to wasting time and money, as well as fueling the hopelessness of never achieving clear skin.</p>
                        <br>
                        <b>Solution</b>
                        <p>Design an application for both men and women, who are stuck on "fixing" their acne and wish to understand more about their body and how that influences their acne.

                <p>Glow accomodates users by featuring products that are widely available for mild to moderate acne. However, more severe cases of acne are best solved by the expertise of a dermatologist and prescribed medication. For a safer and more reliable treatment, users who have severe acne and who haven't visited the doctor recently cannot use the app.</p>

            <b style="margin-bottom: 2%">Do people need an app like this?</b>
            <p>To learn more about people’s experiences with skincare and acne, I surveyed 22 people who had at least one skin condition.</p>
            <p>I learned that participants were more comfortable with showing their face to people when their acne was not at its worst or persistent. Most also had another skin condition along with their acne such as eczema or keratosis pilaris. I also asked them to describe how they felt about their acne and how it had affected their self-confidence. Many found it an annoyance or something they had to cover up. However, for some, it got so bad that one look at their face in the mirror would give them suicidal thoughts.</p>
            <p>I wanted to give them a tool that would encourage and allow them to find a solution to do something for their condition so they wouldn’t suffer in silence. I wanted to give them the power to track their journey, find out what they were doing wrong instead of blindly purchasing new and expensive products in hope that it will work for them, and be able to see improvements over time.</p>
            <p>I then sought out to personally learn more about people’s experiences with acne. I spoke to five people who answered my survey and who agreed to talk more about their skincare issues with me. </p>

                <p>“Before I would research products on how to get rid of acne, but <b>they don’t really work</b>. I don't think I've gotten a good product I can rely on even after a few years.” - Cindy C.</p>
                <p>“<b>Going out sometimes was a challenge</b> since I had this big [expletive] pimple on my face. Although people aren't focusing on it, I definitely was.” - Karlin O.</p>
                <p>“My parents didn’t believe in Western medicine and [my acne] never really got to the point where it was that bad. My brother had way more acne than me, and he never went to the doctor’s. <b>I felt like it was something that would eventually pass.</b>” - Bryant H.</p>
                <p>“My main concern for my acne is <b>how to have it all go away and how to get rid of it faster</b>.” - Kahei L.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 2%">I found out people had a cycle of discovering, researching, purchasing, testing, and perfecting their routine. However, some never got to the “perfect routine.” They either gave up or they’re still working on it.</p>
            <p>For interviewees who had other skin issues, they all agreed that the acne on their face was their highest priority. Everyone had or has a skincare routine for their acne, but rarely focused on their other issues because other people were less critical of those areas.
            </p>
            <b>What features should I be prioritizing?</b>
            <p>From my interviews, I created three user stories to prioritize the needs of potential users:</p>
            <h5><span style="color: gray">As a person suffering from acne, I want a routine with </span><span style="color: #fc7978">products that work for me</span><span style="color: gray"> so I can </span><span style="color: #fc7978">effectively get rid of my acne</span>.</h5>
            <h5><span style="color: gray">As a person who already has a good skincare routine, I want to </span><span style="color: #fc7978">find new products</span><span style="color: gray"> to incorporate into my routine to </span><span style="color: #fc7978">treat my remaining issues</span>.</h5>
            <h5><span style="color: gray">As a person who has overcome my acne, I want to find a </span><span style="color: #fc7978">cost-effective repair treatment</span><span style="color: gray"> to </span><span style="color: #fc7978">get rid of my acne scars</span>.</h5>
            <p>My user stories helped me define three specific features that would have a high impact on the app to create a more fluid user flow and create the Minimal Viable Product (MVP): learning about acne and the causes behind it, establishing a routine, and tracking the user journey.

            <b style="margin-bottom: 3%">What features should I prioritize?</b>
            <p>Throughout my user interviews, there were three recurring concerns:</p>
            <p>This led me to prioritize three important components for my app:</p>

            <b style="margin-bottom: 2%">How did the early design look?</b>

        </div>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <b style="margin-bottom: 2%">What did I learn?</b>
        <p>User research is the necessary foundation of any design process. I learned that you must constantly think about the user in every step of the way, understanding who you're designing for, and always asking "why" is crucial in bringing your designs to life.</p>
        <p>Although it is not perfect, I had to go through many iterations before presenting my final prototype. In addition, not all user-suggested changes are necessary. What I thought would be a straightforward application was not as simple as I envisioned. There were some times where I tested my prototypes and found participants confused and stuck on a user flow. I learned that iterations are vital in designing a product that can be understood by all.</p>
        <p>Overall, Glow taught me how to apply conceptual thinking into applied designs. From thinking about the problem to working toward producing a solution, I learned how each step should have a purpose in order to reach the end goal.</p>
