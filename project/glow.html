                        <b>Background</b>
                        <p>Acne affects everyone differently. Glow helps users learn new information about their body, skincare, and medications to aid them in their journey to understand how their own lifestyles play an effect on their acne. In turn, those suffering can feel more self-confident by taking the step to understand their acne and clear it.</p>
                        <br>
                        <b>Problem</b>
                        <p>People who suffer from acne sometimes don’t know or understand their acne’s origins. They try multiple products and/or medications that may or may not work on their specific type of acne, which leads to wasting time and money, as well as fueling the hopelessness of never achieving clear skin.</p>
                        <br>
                        <b>Solution</b>
                        <p>Design an application for both men and women, who are stuck on "fixing" their acne and wish to understand more about their body and how that influences their acne.

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <b>Who am I designing for?</b>
            <p>In order to understand who I was designing for and their needs, I researched who suffers from acne today and how it affects them. Via online research, I found:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“Approximately 85 percent of people between the ages of 12 and 24 experience at least minor acne.” - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.aad.org/media/stats-numbers">American Academy of Dermatology</a></li>
                <li>“Body image issues associated with acne can result in depression, anxiety, social isolation, and low self-esteem.” - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://journals.lww.com/tnpj/Fulltext/2013/10000/Acne_vulgaris__A_review_of_causes_and_treatment.6.aspx">The Nurse Practitioner</a></li>
                <li>“The teenage years in particular are notorious for being socially stressful and challenging; the cosmetic effects of acne can greatly impact an individual's emotional and psychological health at this very crucial point in development.” - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://journals.lww.com/tnpj/Fulltext/2013/10000/Acne_vulgaris__A_review_of_causes_and_treatment.6.aspx">The Nurse Practitioner</a></li>
            </ul>
            <b>Do people need an app like this?</b>
            <p>To learn more about people’s experiences with skincare and acne, I surveyed 22 people who had at least one skin condition.</p>
            <p>Here are a couple of questions and results from my survey:</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../glow/graph-1.jpg">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../glow/graph-2.jpg">
            <p>I learned that participants were more comfortable with showing their face to people when their acne was not at its worst or persistent. Most also had another skin condition along with their acne such as eczema or keratosis pilaris.</p>
            <p>I also asked them to describe how they felt about their acne and how it had affected their self-confidence. Many found it an annoyance or something they had to cover up. However, for some, it got so bad that one look at their face in the mirror would give them suicidal thoughts.</p>
            <p>I wanted to give them a tool that would encourage and allow them to find a solution to do something for their condition so they wouldn’t suffer in silence. I wanted to give them the power to track their journey, find out what they were doing wrong instead of blindly purchasing new and expensive products in hope that it will work for them, and be able to see improvements over time.</p>
            <p>I then sought out to personally learn more about people’s experiences with acne. I spoke to five people who answered my survey and who agreed to talk more about their skincare issues with me. </p>

                <p>“Before I would research products on how to get rid of acne, but <strong style="color: #fc7978">they don’t really work</strong>. I don't think I've gotten a good product I can rely on even after a few years.” - Cindy C.</p>
                <p>“<strong style="color: #fc7978">Going out sometimes was a challenge</strong> since I had this big [expletive] pimple on my face. Although people aren't focusing on it, I definitely was.” - Karlin O.</p>
                <p>“My parents didn’t believe in Western medicine and [my acne] never really got to the point where it was that bad. My brother had way more acne than me, and he never went to the doctor’s. <strong style="color: #fc7978">I felt like it was something that would eventually pass.</strong>” - Bryant H.</p>
                <p>“My main concern for my acne is <strong style="color: #fc7978">how to have it all go away and how to get rid of it faster</strong>.” - Kahei L.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <p>I found out people had a cycle of discovering, researching, purchasing, testing, and perfecting their routine. However, some never got to the “perfect routine.” They either gave up or they’re still working on it.</p>
            <p>For interviewees who had other skin issues, they all agreed that the acne on their face was their highest priority. Everyone had or has a skincare routine for their acne, but rarely focused on their other issues because other people were less critical of those areas.

            <h3>Ideating</h3>
            <b>What features benefit my users the most?</b>
            <p>From my interviews, I created three user stories to prioritize the needs of potential users.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="wrap">
        <div class="container-md content">
            <div class="row">
                <b>User stories:</b>
                <p>As a person suffering from acne, I want a routine with <strong style="color: #fc7978">products that work for me</strong> so I can <strong style="color: #fc7978">effectively get rid of my acne.</strong></p>
                <p>As a person who already has a good skincare routine, I want to <strong style="color: #fc7978">find new products</strong> to incorporate into my routine to <strong style="color: #fc7978">treat my remaining issues.</strong></p>
                <p>As a person who has overcome my acne, I want to find a <strong style="color: #fc7978">cost-effective repair treatment</strong> to <strong style="color: #fc7978">get rid of my acne scars.</strong></p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container-md content">
        <div class="row">
            <p>As a result, I defined three specific features that would have a high impact on the app to create a more fluid user flow and create the Minimal Viable Product (MVP): learning about acne and the causes behind it, establishing a routine, and tracking the user journey.</p>
            <p>In addition, I heard three recurring concerns throughout my interviews:</p>
            <img src="../glow/recurring-thoughts.png">
            <p>This led me to prioritize the three important components for my app as seen in my Design & Solutions section:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>An innovative way for users to track their progress using the product</li>
                <li>Positive language in the product to increase their confidence</li>
                <li>A built-in analysis to decrease the amount of time to get to the optimal routine</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Designing & Testing</h3>
            <b>Going from sketches to digital wireframes.</b>
            <p>With paper wireframes, I guerilla tested 5 participants to see how easily they could navigate through Glow with three given scenarios:</p>
            <img src="../glow/user-testing.png">
            <p>After testing my initial prototype, I went back to the drawing board to reiterate my wireframes.</p>
            <p>I initially wanted to make the onboarding process shorter because I understand people don’t enjoy filling out long forms. In this case, however, I discovered the users were okay with filling out the longer form because the analysis would be more accurate and comprehensive in the end.</p>

            <p>Users also suggested some questions I could add that could increase accuracy in determining causes and solutions for their acne. “Obvious” or irrelevant questions that didn’t contribute to having healthy skin were eliminated. Questions were also rearranged to follow a more logical order.</p>
            <p>Some thought the daily update portion could benefit from having more sections to add in detailed information, such as what medications they were taking or their diet.</p>
            <p>It was also difficult for users to manually take pictures of themselves to track their skin improvement. To alleviate this problem, the picture-taking screen was changed to a Face ID inspired photo capture, which the app would automatically take pictures when users rotated their face.</p>

            <b>Going from wireframes to high-fidelity prototype.</b>
            <p>Using the same scenarios, I did two more rounds of user testing with 10 participants total. For the final iterations, there were two major feedbacks. </p>

            <p>Glow is meant to be used more often at night when the user is finished with their daily routine. It uses colors found in a sunset to correlate with the end of a day. I used Apple’s default typeface because it had a good readability reputation. With a simple UI, the user could easily focus on what was on screen.</p>

            <h3>Reflections</h3>
            <b>What did I learn?</b>
            <p>User research is the necessary foundation of any design process. I learned that you must constantly think about the user in every step of the way, understanding who you're designing for, and always asking "why" is crucial in bringing your designs to life.</p>
            <p>Although it is not perfect, I had to go through many iterations before presenting my final prototype. In addition, not all user-suggested changes are necessary. What I thought would be a straightforward application was not as simple as I envisioned. There were some times where I tested my prototypes and found participants confused and stuck on a user flow. I learned that iterations are vital in designing a product that can be understood by all.</p>
            <p>Overall, Glow taught me how to apply conceptual thinking into applied designs. From thinking about the problem to working toward producing a solution, I learned how each step should have a purpose in order to reach the end goal.</p>
